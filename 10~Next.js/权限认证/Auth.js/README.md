# Auth.js

Auth.js is a runtime agnostic library based on standard Web APIs that integrates deeply with multiple modern JavaScript frameworks to provide an authentication experience thatâ€™s simple to get started with, easy to extend, and always private and secure!

This documentation covers next-auth@5.0.0-beta and later and all other frameworks under the @auth/\* namespace. Documentation for next-auth@4.x.y can still be found at next-auth.js.org.
