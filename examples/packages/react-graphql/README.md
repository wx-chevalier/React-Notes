## BE NICE
The `AppSync.js` file in this repo contains my personal API key.  Additionally, whatever packlist items you add will be visible to everyone who loads/runs this app (it's just one master list for simplicity).

I'm providing my API key as a curtesy to the community.  Do not add vulgar items to the list, or abuse the service outside of enjoying or sharing this demo.

## How to setup your own AppSync API
Watch this video by Nader Dabit - [How to setup GraphQL AppSync](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Xbt7VqkJNc&ab_channel=NaderDabit)

My GraphQL schema is in [AppSyncSchema.json](https://github.com/GantMan/BasicAppSyncExample/blob/master/AppSyncSchema.json)

Once setup, point your AppSync.js file at your AWS server!
